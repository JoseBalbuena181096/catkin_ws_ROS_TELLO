   Path MUST start with '/' if it refers to an absolute path (even when starting with an environment variable)

   Path can contain %{ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE}% to refer to an environment variable
   If the variable is not set, nothing will be done

   Type can be:
   - jar
        == 'path' must be a jar file
        == 'path' is copied to Targets/{target}/Install/jars/release/
   - header_only
        == 'path' must be a folder containing all header files
        == 'path' is copied to Targets/{target}/Install/{libName}/
   - external_project
        == 'path' must be a folder containing the external project root
        == 'path' will be symlinked into ../prebuiltName
