This is	a wireshark plugin for dissecting ARSDK network (wifi) packets.

HOW TO INSTALL
==============
1. Make sure you have a full target source tree with at least the following git
projects: libARCommands, libARNetworkAL, ARSDKBuildUtils.

2. Go to directory libARCommands/WiresharkPlugin and type 'make'.

3. Copy output shared object arsdk.so to directory $HOME/.wireshark/plugins/.
Note that your wireshark version should be at least 1.12.0.


HOW TO USE
==========
1. Launch wireshark.

2. ARSDK packets should appear with protocol 'ARSDK'.
If not, it probably means your drone is not using the default UDP destination
port 54321. You can change this port number in the ARSDK plugin preferences.

3. You can filter/colorize packets with rules using protocol abbreviations:
arsdk.frame (== all ARSDK packets)
arsdk.command (only ARCommands packets),
... and so on.
